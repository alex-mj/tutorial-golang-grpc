Hi.
I'm a simple gRPC service on Golang.

I seem very complex (gRPC and other words).
But actually, I am simple, just go step by step.
1) First we need in server (service), go to https://github.com/alex-mj/simple-grp-srvc/blob/master/service/README.MD.
2) Second we release client: https://github.com/alex-mj/simple-grp-srvc/blob/master/client/README.md
